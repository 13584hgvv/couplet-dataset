This is a project to fetch couplets from [冯重朴_梨味斋散叶_的博客](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/articlelist_1195052695_2_1.html)

Run the spider:
-------------

```
scrapy runspider sina_spider.py
```

It will store the data into `./output/`.


Download the data

There is an already fetched and cleaned dataset that can be used directly with the seq2seq model. You can download it at the release page.
